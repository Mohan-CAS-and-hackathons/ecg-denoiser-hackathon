# Ideas for Your Own Project!
Now that you have this toolkit, what can you build? Here are some ideas to get you started:

-   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Tracker:** Use the R-peak detection from our tutorials to measure the tiny variations in time between heartbeats. This is a great indicator of stress and recovery!
-   **Sleep Apnea Detector:** People with sleep apnea sometimes have changes in their heart rate while they sleep. Can you write a script to detect these patterns in a long ECG recording?
-   **Different Noise Types:** Our denoiser was trained on three types of noise. Can you find or create other types of noise (like from a broken wire) and see if you can retrain the model to remove them?
-   **Mobile App Integration:** Can you build a simple mobile app that uses this model to analyze an ECG signal from a Bluetooth heart rate monitor?
