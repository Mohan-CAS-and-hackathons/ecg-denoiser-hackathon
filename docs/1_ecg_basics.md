# What is an ECG? A Beginner's Guide
An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. Think of it as a picture of your heartbeat's rhythm. A healthy heartbeat has a very specific, repeating pattern.

### The Three Main Parts of a Heartbeat

1.  **P-Wave:** The first small bump. It represents the electrical signal that causes the atria (the top chambers of the heart) to contract.
2.  **QRS Complex:** The big, sharp spike in the middle. This is the most powerful signal, representing the contraction of the ventricles (the bottom chambers) that pump blood to the rest of the body.
3.  **T-Wave:** The final, broader bump. This represents the "reset" phase, as the ventricles prepare for the next beat.

Doctors can diagnose many heart conditions just by looking at the shape, timing, and rhythm of these three parts.
